             <h2 id="industriesduringbritishrule">Crafts and industries of India during British Rule </h2>
            <h5> June 5, 2021</h5>
            <p>The crafts and industries of India during British rule was focusing on two industries, namely textiles and iron and steel. Both these were crucial for industry revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the “workshop of the World”.<br>
              Around 1750s, before the British conquered the Bengal, India was by far the world’s largest producer of cotton textiles. They were extensively traded in southeast Asia and west central Asia. Few most popular names of clothes were Patola weave, chintz, coassaes, bandanna, Jamadani etc.<br>
              In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles-chintz-in England. This act was known as the “Calico Act”. English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. (In 1764 the spinning Jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles.<br>
              The Dutch, the French, and the English made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and Silk textiles in India by importing Silver. But as the English gained power in the Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy goods in India. Instead, they collected the revenues from peasants and Zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian Textiles.<br>
              The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producer in India. Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American market. Exporting to England also became difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles.<br>
              By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the end of nineteenth century two-third of all cotton worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain.<br>
              Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and hand-woven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India and it was put at the Centre of the tricolor flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931.<br>
              The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854(The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861). From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. <br>
              The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was set up in early 1912 on the bank of the river Subarnarekha Jamshedpur, under the guidance of Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata and American geologist Charles Weld.<br>
              TISCO was set up at an opportune time. All though India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. But the situation changed in 1914, the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So, imports of steel from Britain declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the War dragged for several years TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 percent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. And TISCO became the biggest steel industry within British Empire.<br>In the case of iron and steel as in the case of cotton and textiles, industrial growth occurred only when the British into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased.

            <h2 id="HowBritishsaweducationinIndia">How British saw education in India</h2>
            <h5> june 5, 2021</h5>
            <p>What changes were to be introduced? How were Indians to be educated, “civilized”, and made into what the British believed were “good subjects”? The British could find no simple answers to these questions. They continued to be debated for many years.<br>
              In 1783 William Jones arrived in Calcutta. He was an expert in law and was a linguist. He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English.<br>
              Jones discovered that his interests were shared by many British officials in Calcutta at that time. Englishman like Henry Thomas Colebrooke and Nathaniel Halhed were also busy discovering the ancient Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit and Persian works into English. Together with Jones they set up the Asiatic society of Bengal and started a journal called Asiatic Researches.<br>
              They believed that Ancient texts not only help the Britishers learn from Indian culture, but it would also help the Indians rediscover their own heritage, and understand the lost glories of their past. In this process the British would become the guardians of Indian culture as well as its masters.<br>
              With this concept in mind a Madrasa was set up in Calcutta in 1781 and the Hindu college was set up in Benaras in 1791.<br>
              From the early nineteenth century many British officials began to criticize the Orientalist (those with a knowledge of language and culture of Asia.).<br>
              Thomas Babington Macaulay saw India as an uncivilized country that needed to be civilized. No branch of eastern knowledge, according to him could be compared to what England had produced.<br>
              Following Macaulay’s minute, the English Education Act 1835 was introduced. The decision was to make English the medium of instruction for higher Education, and to stop the promotion of Oriental institution like Madrasa in Bengal and Benaras Sanskrit college.<br>
              In 1854 the President of the board of directors of the East India Company Charles Wood introduced “woods Despatch”. Outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in India, it emphasized once again the practical benefits of a system of European learning, as opposed to Oriental knowledge.<br>
              New policies appointed a number of government Pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of Pandits was to visit pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching. Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular timetable.

            <h5> june 6, 2021</h5>
            <p>Have you ever thought of how children lived about two hundred years ago? <br>
              Two hundred years ago things were very different. Most children were married at early age. Widow were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral of pyre of their husbands. Women who died in this manner, whether willingly or not, were called “Sati” meaning virtuous women.<br>
              From the earlier nineteenth century, we find debates and discussions about social customs and practices taking on a new chapter. One important reason for this was the development of new forms of communications. For the first time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and pamphlets were printed.<br>
              All kinds of issues could now be debated and discussed by men and sometimes by women as well in the new cities. The discussion could reach out to a wider public, and could become linked t movements for social change.<br>
              One such reformer was Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833). He founded a reform association known as the Brahmo Sabha (later known as Brahmo Samaj) in Calcutta. He was keen to spread the knowledge of western education in the country and bring about greater freedom and equality for women. He wrote about the way women were forced to bear the burden of domestic work, confined to the home and the kitchen, and not allowed to move out and become educated. Many British also begun to criticize Indian traditions and customs. In 1829, therefore “Sati” was banned.<br>
              One of the most famous reformers, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, used the ancient texts to suggest that widows could remarry. His suggestion was adopted by British officials, and a law was passed in 1856 permitting widow remarriage. Those who were against the remarriage of widows opposed Vidyasagar, and even boycotted him.<br>
              In the Telgu speaking areas of the Madras Presidency, Veerasalingam Pantulu formed an association for widow remarriage. Around the same time young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay pledged themselves to working for the same cause. In the north, Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who founded the reform association called “Arya Samah” also supported widow marriage.<br>
              In the later part of the century, schools for girls were established by the Arya Samaj in Punjab, and Jyotirao Phule in Maharashtra. In aristocratic Muslim households in North India, women learnt to read the Koran and Arabic. They were taught by women who came home to teach. Some reformers such as Mumtaz Ali reinterpreted verses from the Koran to argue for women’s education. The first Urdu novel began to be written from the late nineteenth century. Amongst other things, these were meant to encourage women to read about religion and domestic management in a language they could understand.<br>
              Some of the reformers we have seen discussing also criticized caste inequalities. Rammohun Roy translated an old Buddhist text that was critical of caste. The Prarthana Samaj adhered to the tradition of Bhakti that believed in spiritual equality of all castes. In Bombay, the Paramhans Mandali was founded in 1840 to work for the abolition of caste.<br>
              One of the most vocal amongst the low caste leaders was Jyotirao Phule, born in 1827. He studied in schools developed by Christian missionaries. Phule argued the Aryans were foreigners, who came from outside the subcontinent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country. As the Aryans established their dominance, they began looking at the defeated population as inferior, as low-caste people. According to Phule, the “upper” castes had no right to their land and power: in reality, the land belonged to indigenous people, the so-called low castes.<br>
              In 1873, Phule wrote a book named Gulamgiri, meaning slavery. Some ten years ago before this, the American civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves, thus establishing a link between the conditions of the “lower” castes in India and black slaves in America. <br>
              Ambedkar who was born into a Mahar family. As a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life. On his return to India in 1919 from US he wrote extensively about “upper” caste power in contemporary society. In 1927, Ambedkar started a temple entry movement, in which his Mahar caste followers participated. Brahman priests were outraged when the Dalits used water from the temple tank. Ambedkar led three such movements for temple entry between 1927 and 1935. His aim was to make everyone see the power of caste prejudices within society.<br>
              Debates and struggles over caste continued beyond the colonial period and are still going on in our times.

              <h2 id="Model Tenancy Act 2021">Model Tenancy Act 2021</h2>
              <h5> june 5, 2021</h5>
            <p>To bridge the trust deficit between the landlords and tenants the union government has approved the Model Tenancy Act on June 2, 2021. <br>
                The Model Tenancy Act aims at opening the vacant housing stock in key rental housing markets in India and reduce litigation. “It is expected to give a flip to private participation in rental housing as a business model for addressing the huge housing shortage” as claimed by the government. The provisions in the new Model Tenancy Act are in line with the drafted tenancy bill in 2019. As per real estate experts, this act will help the government strengthen its ‘Housing for All’ initiative and can fuel the rental housing supply by attracting more investors. <br>
                The enactment of the New Model Tenancy Law is left to the State and Union Territories, or they can amend their existing rental laws. This act applies to properties used for residential or commercial purposes. The act covers properties located in urban as well as rural areas. <br>
                <ul>
                <li>A written agreement between the landlord and tenant is a must for new tenancies and should be submitted to the district Rent Authority</li>
                <li>The law is not effective for existing tenancies</li>
                <li>The roles and responsibilities of landlords and tenants are clearly stated in the act</li>
                <li>Responsibilities of the landlord include painting the house, structural repairs (except the ones caused by tenants), plumbing and electrical wiring maintenance </li>
                <li>Responsibilities of tenants include socket and kitchen fixtures repairs, cleaning drains, replacement of glass panels in doors and windows, maintenance of open space around, should avoid intentional damage, and notify the damage to the landowner</li>
                <li>The tenants cannot sublet the property without seeking prior permission from the landlord</li>
                <li>The tenants are allowed to do structural changes only if they have written consent from the landlord</li>
                <li>The landlord cannot stop the tenant from using essential services such as water, electricity, etc.</li>
                <li>The landlord must inform the tenant 24 hours in advance to inspect the premises occupied by the tenant</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Amidst growing concerns around lack of transparency, accountability and rights of users related to digital media and after elaborate consultation with the public and stakeholders, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 has been framed in exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011.<br>
                  While finalizing these Rules, both the Ministries of Electronics and Information Technology and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting undertook elaborate consultations among themselves in order to have a harmonious, soft-touch oversight mechanism in relation to social media platform as well as digital media and OTT platforms etc.<br>
                  Part- II of these Rules shall be administered by Ministry of Electronics and IT, while Part-III relating to Code of Ethics and procedure and safeguards in relation to digital media shall be administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.<br>
                  Background:<br>

                  The Digital India programme has now become a movement which is empowering common Indians with the power of technology. The extensive spread of mobile phones, Internet etc. has also enabled many social media platforms to expand their footprints in India. Common people are also using these platforms in a very significant way. Some portals, whichpublish analysis about social media platforms and which have not been disputed, have reported the following numbers as user base of major social media platforms in India:<br>
                  <ul>
                      <li>WhatsApp users: 53 Crore</li>
                      <li>YouTube users: 44.8 Crore</li>
                      <li>Facebook users: 41 Crore</li>
                      <li>Instagram users: 21 Crore</li>
                      <li>Twitter users: 1.75 Crore</li>
                  </ul>
                      <br>
                      These social platforms have enabled common Indians to show their creativity, ask questions, be informed and freely share their views, including criticism of the Government and its functionaries. The Government acknowledges and respects the right of every Indian to criticizeand disagree as an essential element of democracy. India is the world’s largest open Internet society and the Government welcomes social media companies to operate in India, do business and also earn profits. However, they will have to be accountable to the Constitution and laws of India.<br>
                      Proliferation of social media,on one hand empowers the citizens then on the other hand gives rise to some serious concerns and consequences which have grown manifold in recent years. These concerns have been raised from time to time in various forums including in the Parliament and its committees, judicial orders and in civil society deliberations in different parts of country. Such concerns are also raised all over the world and it is becoming an international issue.<br>
                      Of late,some very disturbing developments are observed on the social media platforms. Persistent spread of fake news has compelled many media platforms to create fact-check mechanisms.Rampant abuse of social media to share morphed images of women and contents related to revenge porn have often threatened the dignity of women. Misuse of social media for settling corporate rivalriesin blatantly unethical manner has become a major concern for businesses.Instances of use of abusive language, defamatory and obscene contents and blatant disrespect to religious sentiments through platforms are growing.<br>
                      Over the years, the increasing instances of misuse of social media by criminals, anti-national elements have brought new challenges for law enforcement agencies. Theseinclude inducement for recruitment of terrorists, circulation of obscene content, spread of disharmony, financial frauds, incitement of violence, public order etc.<br>
                      It was found that currently there is no robust complaint mechanism wherein the ordinary users of social media and OTT platforms can register their complaint and get it redressed within defined timeline. Lack of transparency and absence of robust grievance redressal mechanism have left the users totally dependent on the whims and fancies of social media platforms. Often it has been seen that a user who has spent his time, energy and money in developing a social media profile is left with no remedies in case that profile is restricted or removed by the platform without giving any opportunity to be heard.<br>
                      <br>
                      <h6>Guidelines Related to Social Media to Be Administered by Ministry of Electronics and IT:</h6>
              <ul>
                        <li>
                        Due Diligence To Be Followed By Intermediaries: The Rules prescribe due diligence that must be followed by intermediaries, including social media intermediaries. In case, due diligence is not followed by the intermediary, safe harbour provisions will not apply to them.</li>
                        <li>
                        Grievance Redressal Mechanism: The Rules seek to empower the users by mandating the intermediaries, including social media intermediaries, to establish a grievance redressal mechanism for receiving resolving complaints from the users or victims. Intermediaries shall appoint a Grievance Officer to deal with such complaints andshare the name and contact details of such officer. Grievance Officer shall acknowledge the complaint within twenty four hours and resolve it within fifteen days from its receipt.</li>
                        <li>
                        Ensuring Online Safety and Dignity of Users, Specially Women Users: Intermediaries shall remove or disable access withing 24 hours of receipt of complaints of contents that exposes the private areas of individuals, show such individuals in full or partial nudity or in sexual act or is in the nature of impersonation including morphed images etc. Such a complaint can be filed either by the individual or by any other person on his/her behalf.</li>
                        <li>
                        Two Categories of Social Media Intermediaries: To encourage innovations and enable growth of new social media intermediaries without subjecting smaller platforms to significant compliance requirement, the Rules make a distinction between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. This distinction is based on the number of users on the social media platform. Government is empowered to notify the threshold of user base that will distinguish between social media intermediaries and significant social media intermediaries. The Rules require the significant social media intermediaries to follow certain additional due diligence.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h6>Additional Due Diligence to Be Followed by Significant Social Media Intermediary:</h6>
