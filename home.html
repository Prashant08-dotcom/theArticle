            <h5> June 5, 2021</h5>
            <p>The crafts and industries of India during British rule was focusing on two industries, namely textiles and iron and steel. Both these were crucial for industry revolution in the modern world. Mechanised production of cotton textiles made Britain the foremost industrial nation in the nineteenth century. And when iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the “workshop of the World”.<br>
              Around 1750s, before the British conquered the Bengal, India was by far the world’s largest producer of cotton textiles. They were extensively traded in southeast Asia and west central Asia. Few most popular names of clothes were Patola weave, chintz, coassaes, bandanna, Jamadani etc.<br>
              In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles-chintz-in England. This act was known as the “Calico Act”. English producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. The first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry. (In 1764 the spinning Jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles.<br>
              The Dutch, the French, and the English made enormous profits out of this flourishing trade. These companies purchased cotton and Silk textiles in India by importing Silver. But as the English gained power in the Bengal, it no longer had to import precious metal to buy goods in India. Instead, they collected the revenues from peasants and Zamindars in India, and used this revenue to buy Indian Textiles.<br>
              The development of cotton industries in Britain affected textile producer in India. Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American market. Exporting to England also became difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles.<br>
              By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. In fact, by the end of nineteenth century two-third of all cotton worn by Indians were made of cloth produced in Britain.<br>
              Mahatma Gandhi urged people to boycott imported textiles and use hand-spun and hand-woven cloth. Khadi gradually became a symbol of nationalism. The charkha came to represent India and it was put at the Centre of the tricolor flag of the Indian National Congress adopted in 1931.<br>
              The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854(The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861). From the early nineteenth century, Bombay had grown as an important port for the export of raw cotton from India to England and China. <br>
              The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO) was set up in early 1912 on the bank of the river Subarnarekha Jamshedpur, under the guidance of Dorabji Tata, the eldest son of Jamsetji Tata and American geologist Charles Weld.<br>
              TISCO was set up at an opportune time. All though India was importing steel that was manufactured in Britain. But the situation changed in 1914, the First World War broke out. Steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So, imports of steel from Britain declined dramatically and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the War dragged for several years TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90 percent of the steel manufactured by TISCO. And TISCO became the biggest steel industry within British Empire.<br>In the case of iron and steel as in the case of cotton and textiles, industrial growth occurred only when the British into India declined and the market for Indian industrial goods increased.
