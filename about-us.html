  <div style="text-align: left;">  <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Isn’t it too much effort asking seniors or even classmates for notes each time you have an exam? Now, with semesters online most of the content you’d have to otherwise  is made available online in google classrooms across sections.  Why can’t it be consolidated in one place?<br><br>

        Made available on request, sorted into semesters and ready to go instead of having to download all files to your device. We have built ‘theArticle’ keeping all this in mind. Your one stop destination to avail all study material (Notes, PDFs and Books) to get that 9 CGPA this semester. theArticle is a Notes, PDFs, and Book viewer Web app made for students of India.
